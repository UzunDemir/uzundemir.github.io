## 5 random facts about me:

1. When I was a schoolboy, I really liked the subject of computer science, I attended an additional circle on this subject, won prizes at various olympiads, but ... after graduating from school, I went to study in a completely different specialty. Thus, I was far from programming for 25 years!

2. Once at school, for one creative evening, it was necessary to prepare and perform a song on the guitar. I never played the guitar and had no idea about notes and so on! What did I do‚Ä¶ I just tuned the guitar by ear, and with simple 3-4 chords (which I also invented myself) I picked up a song and successfully performed at the school evening!

3. The Great Escape Artist from the Matrix of Accounting

I traded balance sheets for tensors, ledgers for loss functions‚Äîa quantum leap from the world of `1C` and `Excel` (2004‚Äì2016) to the realm of `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`. My transition from `chief accountant` to `ML engineer` wasn‚Äôt just a career change‚Äîit was a 300% skill tree respec, like Neo swapping his office drone suit for a black trench coat of machine learning badassery.

Back then, I spoke the language of `debits` and `credits`; now I optimize `gradient descent` instead of tax deductions. My old calculator? Repurposed as a paperweight for my arXiv printouts. The only "financial statements" I care about now are confusion matrices and `ROC curves`.

They said accounting was stable‚Äîbut stability is overrated when you can build models that predict fraud, diagnose diseases, and outsmart Sber‚Äôs anti-fraud systems instead. Turns out, my real superpower wasn‚Äôt balancing books‚Äîit was rebalancing neural network weights.

So here‚Äôs to every spreadsheet jockey dreaming of breaking free: Your `Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V` skills are just pre-training for the real AI revolution. The red pill? It‚Äôs called `pip install torch.`

4. I have been doing sports all my life. For the first time my mother brought me to the judo hall when I was 5 years old! Since then, I have been practicing almost all the time (in my school years - judo and handball, in my student years - boxing and kickboxing). Nowadays, I just keep myself in great physical shape. So, for example, about three years ago, my personal record for pulling up on the crossbar was 37 times! Now I easily pull up 25 times.

5. **Secret Fact: I Outsourced My Creativity to RAG**
My AI assistant now:

- Writes my presentations (and gets standing ovations)

- Cracks jokes in chats (funnier than mine)

- Even composed this text itself

The only thing it can‚Äôt do yet? Sign NDAs. So technically, I‚Äôm still in charge.

P.S. If this text seems suspiciously accurate... Perhaps I am that very RAG. ü§ñ
*(Check your vector index. And hide your API keys.)*

**I**: thinking I control the process

**My RAG**: ghostwriting my memoirs in the background

*We've reached the point of no return.* ‚ò†Ô∏è
