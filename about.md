Some information about me!

### 5 random facts about me:

1. When I was a schoolboy, I really liked the subject of computer science, I attended an additional circle on this subject, won prizes at various olympiads, but ... after graduating from school, I went to study in a completely different specialty. Thus, I was far from programming for 25 years!

2. Once at school, for one creative evening, it was necessary to prepare and perform a song on the guitar. I never played the guitar and had no idea about notes and so on! What did I doâ€¦ I just tuned the guitar by ear, and with simple 3-4 chords (which I also invented myself) I picked up a song and successfully performed at the school evening!

3. When I met my future wife, I was already thinking about how to earn money and went to a six-month accounting course ... But after studying for only one month, I got a job as a chief accountant in a small trading company. About two years later, I was independently accounting for 10 small firms. And three years later I was already working as a chief accountant at a large manufacturing enterprise with 600 employees!

4. I once opened [two retail stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQIOg3dqD-w) selling toys, stationery and gifts in 2.5 months! I independently designed and assembled (with my beloved daughter Kamelia) [commercial furniture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4kNVjCLSKc&list=PLqQg8bYvyjQyy8zCInOguOoL2Ow9hvD90), entered a huge amount of goods into the database, set up an accounting program and connected all the equipment (cash register, scanner, server, etc.) into a single network, bought and put goods in stores website launched! 
I myself filmed and edited advertising [clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6lfJT4irfs&list=PLqQg8bYvyjQyy8zCInOguOoL2Ow9hvD90&index=8), administered the group on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JucariiJulia) and Instagram. In addition, I did not forget to take care of my little [son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYmoHocTcjk&list=PLqQg8bYvyjQyy8zCInOguOoL2Ow9hvD90&index=6), whom I love very much.

In fairness, I must say that this adventure brought me about $ 25,000 in losses, and I closed these stores a year later! Such a bad experience, but this is my experience and my way!

5. I have been doing sports all my life. For the first time my mother brought me to the judo hall when I was 5 years old! Since then, I have been practicing almost all the time (in my school years - judo and handball, in my student years - boxing and kickboxing). Nowadays, I just keep myself in great physical shape. So, for example, about three years ago, my personal record for pulling up on the crossbar was 37 times! Now I easily pull up 25 times.
