So, friends, it's done! My successful writing of [the final work](https://uzundemir.github.io//fihal-project) gave me even more confidence in the chosen direction in which I would like to develop to the maximum! Among the necessary knowledge, Her Majesty - Mathematics - becomes the cornerstone! Therefore, I am happy to start studying the course "Fundamentals of Mathematics for Data Science"! 

As you noticed, I switched to English because it is the standard in information technology. I will not hide that I use google translate, but I will also try to improve my knowledge in English.

## So let's get started!

1. Analytics and ML. Basic math objects and SymPy. Fractions and conversions. (Аналитика и ML. Базовые математические объекты и SymPy. Дроби и преобразования.)

    1.1 Введение
    
    [1.2 Основные операции с дробями](https://github.com/UzunDemir/uzundemir.github.io/files/11247139/Math.practice.fractions-1.pdf) / [*Answers](https://github.com/UzunDemir/uzundemir.github.io/files/11247201/Math.practice.fractions.answers-1.pdf)
