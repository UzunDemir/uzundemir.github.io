# Why? 

I chose **Machine Learning Engineer** because it’s the perfect fusion of logic, creativity, and real-world impact. It allows me to turn raw data into smart systems — predicting risks, diagnosing diseases, fighting fraud, or even generating text and art. I’m driven by the thrill of building models that learn and adapt, the elegance of algorithms that solve complex problems, and the opportunity to shape the future through AI. It’s not just a job — it’s my way to engineer meaningful change.
